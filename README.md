# TaylorSwiftApp

-------------------------
### React-Native App

Yes, an entire app dedicated to buying Taylor Swift albums. 

As my first React-Native App, I make use of Axios API to grab a JSON list of Taylor Swift albums. In this JSON list are values with artist thumbnail images, album artwork image, and external Amazon links to purchase each album. Simply click Buy Now to be redirected to the subsequent Amazon page to buy the Taylor Swift album.

I don't know why you would, but you can clone the app and run an emulator to see it in action.
